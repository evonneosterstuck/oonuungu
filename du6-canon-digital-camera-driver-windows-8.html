Right now, neither the computer nor the laptop can read SD cards. I tried connecting a new SDXC card I just bought to both computers and it's not reading either.

So i try online and there is no update, or if I go to the windows download site it redirects me to their auto windows update and tells me to fuck off and have a great day.
